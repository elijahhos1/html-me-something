            <h2 class="year-headers">2016-17: Truman State University</h2>
            <p>During my freshman year at Truman State,
                I studied computer science and found myself very
                intrigued by the subject.</p>
            <p>While the coursework was very demanding and 
                a new concept for me, every program I completed
                gave me a sense of accomplishment.</p>

            <p>This is Violette Hall, which was basically my second dorm room and where my 
                classes were held. Here, we learned ADA and Javaâ€”both of which helped me 
                develop skills I have used in my LaunchCode assignments and studios.</p>

            <h3 class="year-headers">Fall 2017: University of Missouri Columbia</h3>
            <p>As it turns out, I was quite indecisive about where I wanted 
                to study computer science.</p>
            <p>Since Truman State was a little boring for me (it was set in a town of 
                7,000 people after all), I decided to switch universities.</p>

            <p>At Mizzou I learned C. While it was a hard language to
                work in, I came to appreciate how powerful it was. Learning about 
                pointers and how to use them was especially interesting to me, as 
                I got to learn about how programs store variables in memory and 
                how to manipulate that memory. A difficult concept at first but also 
                very rewarding and informative.</p>
            <p>However, after my time at Mizzou I no longer pursued a computer science degree. 
                I believe that at the time, I didn't have the work ethic to complete 
                my &quot;gen-ed&quot; coursework, and I wasn't in the right headspace to continue my degree.</p>

            <h3 class="year-headers">After College: 2017-2020</h3>
            <p>During the next few years, I made a few attempts to go back to school 
                but couldn't find the motivation to complete most of my work. I felt 
                that the community college courses I was taking didn't have the same 
                feel of the universities I attended.</p>
            <p>Around this time, I mostly worked for my stepdad doing landscaping in 
                the hell that is Missouri in the summer. I knew that working for him was not 
                what I wanted to do with my life, but I had no direction and no idea what 
                to do next.</p>
            <p>Eventually my mother told me that one of her coworkers was currently doing a program  
                called LaunchCode. I had never heard of it before, though I knew 
                coding bootcamps existed and hadn't taken the time to research them. After 
                she graduated from the program and quickly got a job, I thought it may 
                be what I needed.</p>
            <p>I believe that LaunchCode really is right for me, as I always wanted to 
                pursue computer science and computer science alone. It has been 
                something that I'm relatively good at, and to pursue this profession without 
                having to pay a stupid amount of money is a godsend.</p>
